Hi ðŸ‘‹  
This is the website used to our community to understand how the **TAIKAI** platform works. TAIKAI is a hackthon/open innovation network that is built to provide a system to run challenge based competitions where organizers propose competitions to our community of innovators. The platform as a facilitator medium provides a set of tools that simplifies the registration, submisionm evaluation of projects to allow stakeholders to have a smooth experience across the competitions.

## Community Stakeholders

* **Challenge Promoters** (Companies, Universities, Communities) â€” They curate and promote challenges on the community and pay token or/and fiat prices to reward the best projects. By launching challenges on the community they get access to a talent pool of innovators and diverse solutions to solve their business or digital problems.

* **Innovators** (Students, Freelancers, Startups) â€” They create projects for challenges launched on the platform. They get tokens and prizes in return for creating good quality projects and social recognition for their innovative proposals.

* **Backer** (Experts on Field) â€” They evaluate and analyze the innovative solutions submitted by the innovators for challenge providers and rewards for curating and selecting the best projects are used as the incentive.

* **Mentor** â€” They play a significant role on the platform by mentoring projects during the project ideation and construction.
