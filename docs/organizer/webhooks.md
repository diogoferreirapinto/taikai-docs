Connect your Hackathon to your favorite apps

TAIKAI hackathon is able to integrate with your favorite apps to automate your event workflows and create engagement experiences that will leverage your hackathon to a different level.

Webhook are custom callbacks triggered by certain events happening during TAIKAI hackathon. These callbacks carry messages that may be used in platforms like:
- Zapier
- n8n

- etc.

for third-party applications intergations. 

Apart from productivity gains, the integration with other applications allow us to extend our functionalities by allowing the hackathon organizers to create data automations and engagement flows that as a consequence will increment the audience interaction and simplify processes.

The automation also saves you time by taking on some of your more mindless, repetitive tasks and helps you stay organized by making sure information is transferred accurately  between the event main participants.

### 2. What may you use them for?

Some of events that are propagated to external services are:

- Participant Registration 
- Jury Registration 
- New Project Submission 
- Hackathon Step Change

These allow countless oportunities of automations like:

- creating a Twitter / Slack / Discord bot that will publish the main hackathon updates, new submissions or inform the participants that a new deadline is approaching;
- following the Hackathon Voting - Gather all the votes and deliver streamline voting reports or realtime charts to your most important event stakeholders;
- filling in a spreadsheet with all projects, all votes and all actions that take place throughout the hackathon;
