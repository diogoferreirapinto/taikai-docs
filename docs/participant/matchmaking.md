## How to use the Matchmaking feature?

Right now, at the TAIKAI platform, you have **two options** to build the perfect team to create an amazing project for a challenge:

<!-- TODO: add images -->

1. Create your project without a team and then **create project positions** you want to be filled (kinda like a job board of a company);
2. Go to the **Innovators tab** and look for those who are available, according to the skills you're looking for (a tinder based on skills instead of looks) and invite them to your team.

If you don't have a clear idea on what to build and you want to be part of an existing team, go to the **Matchmaking tab** and select one of two options:

1. Click on **"Yes" to set yourself available** as an innovator to join an existing team;
2. Browse the **Open Positions** from existing teams and apply one that suits your skillset.
